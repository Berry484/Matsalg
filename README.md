## ✨ Overview

I created **Matsalg.no** at **age 17** as part of a **high school entrepreneurship project**. This was my first larger software project, and since I was very new to programming, the codebase is quite shit.

During the semester, the app attracted over **2,100 users**. I developed the entire application myself.

**Matsalg.no** is a **food marketplace app** that enables farmers to sell products directly to their customers through the platform. Key features include:

- **Real-time chat** using WebSockets.
- **Self hosted backend** made using spring boot and postgresql.
- **User authentication** via Firebase, supporting Google Sign-In, Apple Sign-In and email/phone Sign-In.
- **Clean and intuitive UI** — frontend built with Flutter, designed with usability and simplicity in mind.
- A **scalable marketplace**, each endpoint made with scalability in mind.

Through this project, I got a taste of what it takes to **design a larger application, quickly learn new technologies, and develop under tight deadlines**.
