## âœ¨ Overview

I created **Matsalg.no** at **age 17** as part of a **high school entrepreneurship project**. This was my first larger software project, and since I was very new to programming, the codebase is quite shit.

During the semester, the app attracted over **1,600 users**. I developed the entire application myself.

**Matsalg.no** is a **food marketplace app** that enables farmers to sell products directly to their customers through the platform. Key features include:

- **Real-time chat** powered by WebSockets
- **User authentication** via Firebase, supporting email, phone, Google Sign-In, and Apple Sign-In
- A **scalable marketplace**, stress-tested with over 100,000 listings without performance issues

This project demonstrates my ability to **design, implement, and deploy a full-stack mobile application independently**, even as a beginner.
